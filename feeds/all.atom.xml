According to the &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/welcome.html"&gt;department's website&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="quote"&gt;The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department is among the leading departments of its kind in the nation,
    with a diverse program of over 100 courses per semester, 143 faculty members,
    1880+ undergraduate, and almost 1100 graduate students&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I thought it'd be cool to see how students fare grade and course wise in this department&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grade Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grade data used in this blog post was obtained directly from the University of Michigan itself and covers the following
four semesters: Winter and Fall for the years 2016 and 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also the same data we use for course distribution visualisations over
at the Michigan Daily &lt;a href="https://gradeguide.com"&gt;GradeGuide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The EECS Department in Numbers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated above, the department is a fairly big one with upwards of 1800 undergrad and 1100 grad students. But how does
it stack up against other departments in the University?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="quote warning"&gt;The course data we received doesn't tell us exactly how many unique students took a course
as part of the department, rather just the number of students in each course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since, we can't figure out how many unique students are a part of a department, let's look at average enrollment by
course.&lt;/p&gt;
