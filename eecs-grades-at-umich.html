        <p>The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department at the University of Michigan is one of it's biggest.
According to the <a href="https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/about/welcome.html">department's website</a>,</p>
<p class="quote">The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department is among the leading departments of its kind in the nation,
    with a diverse program of over 100 courses per semester, 143 faculty members,
    1880+ undergraduate, and almost 1100 graduate students</p>

<p>Because of this, I thought it'd be cool to see how students fare grade and course wise in this department</p>
<h2>Grade Data</h2>
<p>The grade data used in this blog post was obtained directly from the University of Michigan itself and covers the following
four semesters: Winter and Fall for the years 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>It is also the same data we use for course distribution visualisations over
at the Michigan Daily <a href="https://gradeguide.com">GradeGuide</a>.</p>
<h3>The EECS Department in Numbers</h3>
<p>As stated above, the department is a fairly big one with upwards of 1800 undergrad and 1100 grad students. But how does
it stack up against other departments in the University?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><p class="quote warning">The course data we received doesn't tell us exactly how many unique students took a course
as part of the department, rather just the number of students in each course.</p></p>
<p>Since, we can't figure out how many unique students are a part of a department, let's look at average enrollment by
course.</p>
