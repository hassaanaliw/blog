Most of my work begins with the same goal: make boring tasks simpler and become lazier in the process. This project sort of got out of hand and I spent most of my A-Level time working on this.

You might have heard of Facebook Messenger bots. Basically you can send messages to a Facebook page from the messenger apps on iOS and Android or from the Facebook website on your laptops and it can carry out really any task it has been programmed to. 

This presented a pretty good opportunity and the question arose: exactly how much could I get such a bot bot to do for me?

Quite a lot is the answer.


<h4>Downloading Youtube Videos</h4>

The Messenger app provides an easy way to save any videos sent in a chat so all we need to do is to program our bot to download and send Youtube videos to us which we can then save directly to the gallery.

<h4>And much, much more</h4>
